## ‚úÖ Current Progress (as of Aug 25, 2025)

We now have a working **daily ingestion pipeline** powered by **Apache Airflow**:

- **Scripts:**
  - `scripts/jobs/fetch_prices.py` ‚Üí pulls daily OHLCV data (AAPL, MSFT) from Yahoo Finance and upserts into SQLite (`stocks` table).
  - `scripts/jobs/fetch_news.py` ‚Üí fetches financial headlines from NewsAPI and upserts into SQLite (`news` table).
- **Database:**
  - SQLite DB at `data/marketsense.db`
  - Tables: `stocks`, `news` (both idempotent upserts, safe to re-run).
- **Airflow DAG:**
  - `airflow/dags/marketsense_daily_ingest.py` runs both jobs in sequence.
  - Confirmed to succeed: DAG runs insert new rows daily without duplicates.
- **Verification:**
  - `scripts/dev/check_db.py` prints current DB schema and row counts.
  - Manual test: clearing DB ‚Üí running DAG ‚Üí verified fresh ingestion of ~20 stock bars + ~100 news headlines.
